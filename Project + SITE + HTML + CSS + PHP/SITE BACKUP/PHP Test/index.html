<h1 class="var1_1_h1">PHP</h1>
<h2 class="var1_1_h2">From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia</h2>

<p class="var2_p">PHP is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language"> 
    general-purpose </a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">scripting language </a>
     
    especially suited to web development. It was originally created by 
    Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.The PHP reference 
    implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.PHP originally stood for
     Personal Home Page,but it now stands for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_initialism">recursive initialism </a> PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
    </p>
    
    <p class="var2_p">PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP
     interpreter implemented as a module, 
    a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web 
    server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code – which may 
    be 
    any type of data, such as generated HTML  or binary image data – would 
    form the whole or part of an 
    HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management 
    systems, and web frameworks exist 
    which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, 
    PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical 
    applications and robotic drone control.Arbitrary PHP code can also be interpreted and executed 
    via command-line interface (CLI).</p>
    
    <p class="var2_p">The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. 
        PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and 
        platform, free of charge.
        The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original 
        implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow. 
        Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.
        As of December 2020, 72% of PHP websites use discontinued versions of PHP, i.e. PHP 7.2 or lower no longer 
        supported by The PHP Development Team; and large additional fraction is on PHP 7.3 that is by 
        now "supported for critical security issues only."[13] Over 40% of all PHP websites use version 5.6 or older,
        that not even Debian supports (Debian 9 supported version 7.0 and 7.1).</p>
